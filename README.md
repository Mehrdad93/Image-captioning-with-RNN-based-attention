# Image-captioning-with-RNN-based-attention

We introduce an attention based model that automatically learns to generate a caption for images. Our model consists of a novel attention module which includes an elegant modification of GRU architecture. We validate the use of our attention model on a benchmark datasets MSCOCO, and compare its performance with other sate-of-the-art models.
