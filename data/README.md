We performed experiments on MS COCO dataset, contains complex day-to-day scenes of common objects in their natural context. The dataset contains 82,783 training images, 40,504 validation images, and 40,775 test images. Each image is annotated with 5 sentences using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Since, there is an ongoing competition on this dataset, annotation for test dataset is not available. To train our model, we have used both training and validation sets. To test the proposed model, we have hold out 5000 samples of the validation set. The same split is used for all the experiments.
